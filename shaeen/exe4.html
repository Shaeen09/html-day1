            <h1> Introduction </ h1>

            <p>Lions are mainly found in Africa but can also be seen in

                India and parts of Asia. They like the hot places like the

                Sahara in Africa and the dryer regions. </p>

            <h1>Appearance</ h1>

            <p>African lions are the lions you see most often. All lions

                look very similar but they've evolved to adapt to their home

                lands. The Asian lion is a good example. They have gold fur

                and a gold mane unlike the African lion. This is because of

                the rich dirt in Asia. </p>
