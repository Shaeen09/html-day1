    Like a movie scene
    In the sweetest dream
    I have pictured us together
    Now to feel your lips
    On my fingertips
    I have to say is even better
    Than I ever thought it could possibly be
    It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
    From all of my sadness
    The tears that I've cried
    I have spent all my life
            </pre>

    Waiting for tonight, oh
    When you wou
    ld be here in my arms
    Waiting for tonight, oh
    I've dreamed of this love for so long
    Waiting for tonight
    Oh, oh

    Tender words you say
    Take my breath away
    Love me now and leave me never
    Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
    I want to stay in this forever
    I think of the days when the sun used to set
    On my empty heart
    All alone in my bed
    Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
    I knew I had to hold on

    When you would be here in my arms
    Waiting for tonight, oh
